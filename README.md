# Breaking Zack Tabudlo into the US!

This is the repository for the files for the Streamlit Deployment of DSF Cohort 10 Sprint 2 Group 2. You can view the app through this [link](https://lesmonsaluta-sprint2deployment-deploy-mgw33l.streamlit.app/).

## Premise
Republic Records was launched in the Philippines, and their roster included Zack Tabudlo. 

## About

The project analyzed [Zack Tabudlo's Spotify Streams Data](https://open.spotify.com/artist/67IN4cLJ7798gUapyZlmac). The goal was to help Zack Tabudlo rise to popularity in the United States (through Republic Records) and share the gift of OPM to the rest of the world. To reach the goal, Zack's Spotify Data was obtained through Spotipy through [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), and was compared with what is popular in the US. 

We also developed a recommender engine to generate songs to be included in a playlist.

## Libraries

The project was done by compiling Jupyter Notebooks from the different contributors of the group. The creators utilized Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn, Visualization Libraries (MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Plotly), Spotipy (Spotify API), and Streamlit.
